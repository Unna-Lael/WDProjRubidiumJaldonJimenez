### **4. How JS Will Be Incorporated**

JavaScript will be used primarily on the **“Actual Game”** part of the website, which simulates the visual novel/dating sim experience.  
It will handle interactive elements and dynamic dialogue display, allowing players to click through conversations, make choices, and see corresponding sprite or background changes (without reloading the page).

**JS will:**
- Control the typewriter text effect for character dialogue.  
- Manage choice buttons that change the next line of dialogue and character reactions.  
- Trigger sprite swaps or background transitions based on player decisions.  
- Save simple progress or affection points using `localStorage`, so players can resume or see different endings.  
- Add smooth page transitions, hover animations, and background music control across pages.
